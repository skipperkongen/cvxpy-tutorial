## Minimize convex and concave functions

### Second-degree polynomial

### Fourth-degree polynomial

Even though the package name "cvxpy" implies convex problems, it can also find the
minimum of concave functions like this fourth-degree polynomial:

```
f(x) = 4x^4 + 8x^3 + x^2 - 4x - 2
```

![f(x) = 4x^(4) + 8x^(3) + x^(2) - 4x - 2](./problem3.png)
